# Kayak Cross

On the kayak cross race, the water swirls, and the athletes prepare to battle the strength of the currents. As the kayakers focus, a question lingers in your mind: which starting positions could lead to victory if they were only carried by the current?

The kayak racing area is modeled as a grid with `N` rows and `M` columns, with flow directions on each cell: `v`, `>`, `^`, `<`. Where:

 * `v` indicates downward flow,
 * `>` indicates rightward flow,
 * `^` indicates upward flow,
 * `<` indicates leftward flow.

Every second, each athlete is carried by the current to the next cell based on the direction of the current on their current position. Collisions between kayakers are ignored.

Athletes start from the first row and reach the finish line by crossing the `N`-th row.

**Some starting positions may not allow reaching the finish line, but there is always at least one position that does.**

**The current won't push anyone outside the grid, except for crossing the finish line at row `N`.**

## Data

### Input

**Line 1:** two integers `N` and `M`, separated by a space, representing the number of rows (6 <= `N` <= 50) and the number of columns (4 <= `M` <= 50) of the racing area.

**The next `N` lines:** `M` directions (`v`, `>`, `^` ou `<`) representing the direction of the current on each cell of the given row.

### Output

The starting position(s) that allow crossing the finish line first (output them in increasing order, separated by spaces if multiple positions tie for first).

## Example 1

For the input:

```
8 4
vvvv
v<vv
v>v^
>^v<
v>v<
>v<^
>vv<
>>v<
```

The winning position is:

```
3
```

**Explanation:**

Starting position 1 reaches the end after 14 seconds, position 2 reaches after 15 seconds, position 3 reaches the finish line first after 10 seconds and position 4 never reaches the finish line and remains blocked.

## Example 2

For the input:

```
8 8
>vvvvvv<
>>vv<v>v
^<v>v>vv
>^<<vvvv
>^v<<<vv
v>v^<v<v
vv<<v<<<
vvvv<v>v
```

The winning positions are:

```
4 6
```

**Explanation:**

Positions 4 and 6 reach the finish line first after 12 seconds, positions 5 and 7 arrive after 13 seconds. Starting position 8 finishes after 14 seconds. And positions 1, 2, and 3 never reach the finish line.
