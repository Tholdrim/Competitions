# Competitions

This repository contains tasks and my solutions from various programming competitions and coding challenges I have participated in.

The task statements and the input and output files in this repository are encrypted. Due to the rules of the competition platform, the problem content cannot be redistributed, so these files are included solely for my private reference in case the original sources become unavailable.

## Participation

### [Le Match'Up 2024](https://le-matchup.com/)

**Date:** 9 October 2024  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Language used:** C#  
**Platform:** [Isograd Testing Services](https://www.isograd-testingservices.com/FR/solutions-challenges-de-code?cts_id=129)

During the event, I solved the first four tasks, and later revisited the solutions to improve readability. I also completed the remaining two tasks afterwards. The final task is implemented in a simplified form that does not handle all possible corner cases, but it is sufficient for the official test data provided by the organizers.
